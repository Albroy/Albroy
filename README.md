### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student at [UTBM](https://utbm.fr), where I'm learning to design and develop innovative technological solutions. With a passion for technology that dates back to my childhood, I'm excited to acquire the skills necessary to tackle the technological challenges of the future.
